          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Founded in 2024 by a group of passionate trivia lovers, and officially recognized as a club in 2025, the University of Calgary Trivia Club 
            (UCTC) is where curiosity meets community. We're here to bring together students who love testing their knowledge, 
            discovering new facts, and celebrating the thrill of trivia in all its forms.
          </p>
          
          <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <p>
            We host fun, engaging trivia events for all skill levels: from casual games where you can relax with friends, to semi-competitive 
            matches for those who like a challenge. Whether you're into pop culture, history, science, or the completely random, 
            you'll be sure to have fun.
          </p>

          <h3>What We Promote</h3>

            At UCTC, it's not just about winning... 
            <br></br>
            It's about learning something new, making connections, and enjoying the process.
